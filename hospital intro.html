		<h3 class="titles">Online Hospital Website</h3>
			<p>So someone requested that I design a fictitious website for a doctor who wants to be able to answer patients' questions. Here is what I came up with - I began with a wireframe to give an idea of what I was going to build:<br><br>
				<img src="Hospital wireframe.jpg" id="wireframe" alt="intro screen" width="750px"   height="1700px"><br><br>
				<p>and<span id="highlight"><a href="onlinehospital.html">here</a></span>is the full site. I used cool colors and slightly cursive fonts to give off a warm and welcoming tone as hospitals are often associated with pain and ailments. The site also contains a form to take users questions.</p>
